# WinDat Platform

## Overview
WinDat is a unified platform designed for gamers to play their favorite games one-on-one with friends. The platform will support a variety of games, offer prizes, and provide an enjoyable gaming experience. The first game to be featured on the platform is Counter-Strike 2, and users can participate in exciting matches to win credits.

In the future, the platform will expand to include multiple games, allowing users to challenge each other in various titles. While awaiting community server access from Steam/Valve, the response from the server will be returned as an independent service.

## Features
- **Credits System**: Every user starts with 10,000 credits.
- **Leaderboard**: Track the top players on the platform.
- **Room Creation**: A game room will be created for each match, where two players can connect and compete.
- **Credit Transfer**: The winner of each match will earn credits from the loser.
- **Monthly Rewards**: The top 10 players on the leaderboard at the end of each month will receive special gifts.
- **Future Expansion**: Over the next two years, every one-on-one game across all supported titles will be hosted on the WinDat platform.

## How It Works
1. **User Registration**: Players sign up on the platform and receive 10,000 credits to begin with.
2. **Creating Rooms**: A new game room is created for each match, and two players can join the room to start a game.
3. **Playing the Game**: Players compete against each other in the selected game (CS2, initially). 
4. **Winner Gets Credits**: The winner of each match will receive the credits of the loser.
5. **Leaderboard**: Players will be ranked on the leaderboard based on their performance, with the top 10 players earning rewards each month.
6. **Gifts and Prizes**: At the end of each month, the top 10 players on the leaderboard will receive gifts, with rewards given out periodically.

## Future Development
In the coming months, WinDat will integrate additional games and expand its features to allow all one-on-one gaming to take place through the platform. The domain-driven development will ensure a dynamic and engaging experience for gamers worldwide.
